1. Add Real Data Upload/Parsing
Implement file upload handling in the "Data Upload" tab.
Parse CSV/JSON files and display the uploaded data in the UI.

2. Persist Data Locally
Use localStorage or IndexedDB to save uploaded data so it persists across reloads.

3. Connect to a Backend (Optional)
When ready, connect to an API endpoint for real smartwatch data ingestion.
Replace mock data with live data from your backend.

4. Improve UI/UX
Add loading states, error handling, and confirmation messages.
Make the dashboard responsive for mobile devices.

5. Prepare for ML Integration
Add placeholders or API hooks for ML predictions and risk scores.
Design how model outputs will be visualized (charts, alerts, etc.).

6. Security & Access
If you plan to deploy, consider adding basic authentication.
